This repository contains all data and code associated with Assignment 3 for EDS 220 Remote Sensing and Environmental Data at UC Santa Barbara (Fall 2021 quarter). This project accomplishes the following:
- Discuss the primary characteristics, metadata, and access to NOAA's CoralTemp data products
- Provide example code of loading and working with the dataset
  - Specifically, we show the ability to use this data to forecast future sea surface temperature and degree heating week (DHW). We then highlight the usefulness of these forecasts in predicting the different responses of normal and heat tolerant coral reefs using a case study in Honoli'i, HI. 

Repository Contents:
- HW3_CoralTemp_Tutorial.ipynb: Jupyter notebook containing all dataset details and working code examples.
- environment.yml: environment file for use in creating Binder environment for running Jupyter notebook
- data: Folder containing CoralTemp SST data from 1985-Present
