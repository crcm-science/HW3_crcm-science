    "The CoralTemp data products are maintained by NOAA's Coral Reef Watch Organization (CRW). CRW was established in 2000 to address the need to enhance coral reef resilience.

    "#### Major characteristics\n",
    "\n",
    "CoralTemp is a global sea surface temperature data product used primarily for coral bleaching monitoring. The dataset contains many data products based on 5 geostationary and 3 polar-orbiting satellites. These products include the main sea surface temperature data set (which is the basis for the other products), degree heating week (DHW), bleaching alert areas, coral bleaching hotspots, sea ice fraction, and sea surface temperature anomaly.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Description of data products referenced further:\n",
    "  - SST: Nighttime sea surface temperature (celcius), calibrated to 0.2 meters depth, across the entire globe.\n",
    "  - SST Anomaly: A comparison of current sea surface temperature with the long term mean SST at a given location during a certain period of time\n",
    "    - The temperature anomalies range from -5.0 to +5.0 degrees Celsius (°C). Data and images are updated daily\n",
    "  - Degree Heating Week - The DHW shows how much heat stress (SST above the bleaching threshold) has accumulated in an area.\n",
    "    - The units for DHW are \"degree Celsius-weeks\" (or °C-weeks), combining the intensity and duration of the oceanic heat stress into a single number.\n",
    "  - Bleaching Alert Area\n",
    "    - 5 levels (no stress, bleaching warning, bleaching watch, alert level 1, alert level 2)\n",
    "    - Produced based on DHW\n",
    "    \n",
    "We will focus on the primary sea surface temperature (SST) dataset for the remainder of the notebook. The key details of the SST dataset include: \n",
    "- Spatial Resolution: 5km gridded cells.\n",
    "- Spatial Coverage: The dataset has a complete spatial coverage of the ocean. \n",
    "- Temporal Resolution: 1985-04-01 to present. "

    "#### Known issues with data quality\n",
    "\n",
    "NOAA satellite data sets have specified processing levels ranging from 0 to 4, with 0 indicating unprocessed telemetry data as received and 4 indicating data products that are model output or results from analysis derived from multiple measurements. The CoralTemp SST product is derived from three level-4 satellite datasets:\n",
    "  - NOAA/NESDIS operational near-real-time daily global 5-km geostationary-polar-orbiting (geo-polar) blended night-only SST analysis\n",
    "  - NOAA/NESDIS 2002-2016 reprocessed daily global 5-km geo-polar blended night-only SST analysis\n",
    "  - United Kingdom Met Office 1985-2002 daily global 5-km night-only SST reanalysis of Operational SST and Sea Ice Analysis (OSTIA)\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, the data is gridded and gap-filled according to NOAA’s highest processing level. Therefore, there are no significant gaps in data, spatially or temporally, and all outliers and spikes are likely reflective of real world occurrences.\n",
    "\n",
    "Source: https://coralreefwatch.noaa.gov/product/5km/tutorial/crw05a_sst_product.php\n",
    "\n",
    "However, there are limitations associated with using the dataset, which has a 5-km grid resolution and once-daily measurements. Although sufficient for numerous useful applications, this spatial scale may not be high enough for certain applications, such as drawing conclusions on variation in sea surface temperature within a small area such as a coral reef. Ocean sea surface temperature varies continuously across the surface, not in gridded cells, which could introduce an inherent bias in our analysis. In addition, ocean temperature varies consistently over time, while the dataset only contains a single nighttime reading per day."

    "Our team will demonstrate the ability to use the CoralTemp dataset to analyze heat resilient coral and the effects of rising sea surface temperatures on coral bleaching. Specifically, we will focus on a gridded cell containing a reef known to have heat tolerant coral, located in Honoli'i (near Hilo, Hawai'i). Coral can be heat tolerant for a variety of reasons. This analysis relies on the hypothesis that the coral of Honolii reef have the ability to adapt to heat by hosting a symbiont algae that increases their bleaching threshold by approximately 1.5 degree celsius compared to non heat tolerant coral.\n",

Thus, our analysis extends on this applicability to forecasting the impact of sea surface warming on coral reefs.

This threshold was identified by scientists in the 1980s, who found that corals experience stress if water reaches 1°C warmer than the highest expected annual temperature (Glynn and D'Croz, 1990). Thus, the **bleaching threshold** is defined as **1°C warmer than the max monthly mean temperature**. To calculate the long term mean SST for any location, a \"linear regression\", \"recentering\" of the data, and linear interpolation is required (see here for more info: https://coralreefwatch.noaa.gov/product/5km/tutorial/crw07a_ssta_product.php).\n",

    "#### Discussion of results\n",
    "\n",
    "As we can see in the plot above, the increased heat tolerance of certain coral species drastically decreases their likelihood of bleaching and mortality.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most obvious extension of our results would be to improve our forecasting method to use an actual time-series forecasting model, such as Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA) or Double-Seasonal Holt-Winters Forecasting. Clearly, applying a linear increase in sea surface temperature to a single year of data is not an accurate representation of future change. Local sea surface temperature year to year is impacted greatly by El Nino/La Nina events and other factors. This non-linear change in SST can be seen for our observed data from 1985-Present.\n",
    "\n",
    "Further, this analysis could be extended to look at other reefs with known major bleaching events (for example, the 2016-2017 bleaching events impacting the Great Barrier Reef) and visualizing the potential increased tolerance and impact on heat tolerant coral species. "
